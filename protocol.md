# DeRec Protocol

Digital assets are typically protected using secrets, such as passwords or cryptographic keys. However, for a typical user, managing secrets remains cumbersome and error-prone. Not only must the user maintain backups of the secret to avoid losing assets in the event of device loss or malfunction, but the user must also ensure the safety of each backup to avoid being accessed by attackers. DeRec is a novel protocol for secrets management based on secret-sharing amongst a set of helpers (e.g. friends or multiple custody services), who can assist the user to recover their secret when needed. Each helper's share reveals no information about the original secret, and a threshold number of helpers (e.g. half) can be combined to reconstruct the secret. This document covers the different sub-protocols of DeRec: 1) pairing between helpers to establish a secure channel; 2) mechanism for generating and distributing shares of the user's secret; 3) periodic checks on helpers to ensure their ability to assist in recovery; and 4) the recovery protocol.

##  Protocol Overview

Decentralized recovery is a method of safeguarding a user's secret by distributing shares of that secret among multiple helpers, who store their individual share on their local device in order to help the user recover that secret in future. The shares are constructed under a threshold secret-sharing scheme (e.g. Shamir's secret sharing scheme), with a chosen threshold (defaults to half) -- at least three helpers must be present in order to use the protocol. Should the user lose access to their device, they can recover their secret data by retrieving the previously-distributed shares from at least half of their helpers. For successful recovery, the user only needs to recall the identities of half of their helpers and authenticate with them in-person.

For simplicity, we will consider a single instance of the DeRec protocol to only protect one secret. The secret can have arbitrary length, thus making DeRec applicable to several use cases, from protecting root keys for cryptocurrency wallets and password managers to file storage. A secret is shared by first encrypting it with a random key (using AES-GCM, for instance), and then generating shares of the key using (verifiable) Shamir secret sharing. Specifically, each share consists of the ciphertext, a Shamir share of encryption key, and some authentication data that the sharer can use to verify the authenticity of the share during recovery -- note that, depending on the setting, the ciphertext need not be replicated at all helpers. The authentication data is construction-specific (described later), but it will typically include a vector commitment to all shares, and an opening that can be used to verify the contents of the share with respect to the commitment; the commitment will be replicated amongst all helpers, and a majority-rule can be applied to determine the correct commitment during recovery.

From here on, we will refer to the user that is sharing a secret as a sharer, and the party that has agreed to hold onto a share as the helper. Note that there is no communication between helpers, and the helpers are oblivious of each other (and even the total number of helpers protecting a secret). All communication between a sharer and a helper occurs over a secure channel, where each message is signed-then-encrypted -- here, the signature also covers the identity of the message sender and receiver -- using cryptographic keys that are exchanged during a (in-person) pairing protocol. That is, we perform a trusted setup where the parties can exchange public signature and encryption keys, thus giving us a public key infrastructure.

After pairing, a sharer may contact the helper to store a share of the secret. If the secret is modified, or if the helper set is changed to add or exclude a helper, then new shares are generated and transmitted to all helpers; as a result, each share is annotated with a version. Moreover, it is important to ensure that a helper is maintaining the correct share, to reduce the likelihood that corruptions or unwillingness to help cause a failure during recovery. To that end, the sharer periodically requests the helper to verify that they are holding the correct share, via a challenge-response mechanism. For each of these interactions, communication is initiated by the sharer, and the helper is expected to reply within a specified time duration; after sufficient retries, the sharer may give up on the helper, and choose to exclude it from the helper set.

A sharer will typically enter recovery mode when they have lost their devices. For recovery, the sharer must recollect the identity of at least a threshold number of helpers, and pair with them again (in person) in order to exchange public key material for forming a secure communication channel. During recovery, the helper has the option to identify the sharer as an existing user in their contact list, and transmit any share that they may be previously holding for that user. Once a threshold number of shares are collected, the recovering sharer can verify their correctness -- recall that a threshold number of shares are required to determine the correct vector commitment against which to verify any share -- and run the Shamir reconstruction algorithm to derive the encryption key, and then decrypt the ciphertext using that key. If the helpers are acting maliciously, they may send incorrect shares to the recovering sharer; in this case, the sharer must continue pairing and collecting shares until it has a threshold number of shares (of the same version).


### Security and Privacy Guarantees

The DeRec protocol provides the following guarantees:

* privacy: as long as fewer than a threshold number of helpers are corrupt, the sharer's secret and helper set (number of helpers and their identity) remain private;
* liveness: if sufficient number of helpers are available during recovery such that the sharer can access a threshold number of uncorrupted shares of some version, then the recovery process terminates;
* correctness: on termination, the recovery process will output the correct secret value that was shared (for the version that was reconstructed);

| Pairing      | PairRequestMessage received after establishing contact (responder) | MUST app authenticates the user. Calculate parameter ranges overlap. Send PairResponseMessage. MUST store whether this secret was paired in recovery mode or not. <p> If the pairing request is in recovery mode, then this secret MUST be connected to all other secrets by that same user (so that when the list of secrets and versions is requested, it will return the complete list of secrets for that user). |
| Pairing      | UnpairRequestMessage received                                      | MUST Send UnpairResponseMessage. This will now be out of use, as if the pairing hadn’t happened, so the sharer will not be able to recover it. Also, MAY delete all data structures for this sharer (unless regulatory compliance, or their service contract, requires it to be stored).                                                                                                                             |

| Sharing      | StoreShareRequestMessage received                                  | MUST Store/Update share version. MUST delete unneeded versions (outside the keepList). Send StoreShareResponseMessage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Recovery     | GetSecretIdsVersionsRequestMessage received                        | MUST Send GetSecretIdsVersionsResponseMessage with all secrets and versions for this sharer. This MUST only reveal other secret IDs if it is received through the communication channel of a secretID paired in recovery mode. Otherwise, it only returns the versions associated with the current secretID, with a result status of PARTIAL.                                                                        |
| Recovery     | GetShareRequestMessage received                                    | MUST send GetShareResponseMessage with the share and appropriate error code. This MUST only return the share if it is either requested through the same secret ID that is being requested, or is requested through a secret ID that was paired in recovery mode.                                                                                                                                                     |
